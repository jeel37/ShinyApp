# Titanic: Who survived on the Titanic?

The Titanic dataset is a record of who survived the titanic tragedy and who did not, and what category of Age, Sex and Class they belonged to. Using this dataset, as part of the Developing Data Products Final Assignment, here I present a Web Application created using Shiny where you can find out the statistics of survival by changing the parameters of the demographics: Age, Sex, Class.

The first tab shows the survival comparison of Male and Female passengers for the selected data. 
The second tab shows the survival comparison of passengers belonging to First Class, Second Class, Third Class and Crew members for the selected data.
The third tab show the survival of Children for the selected data.
The fourth tab shows the survival of Adults for the selected data.

The interactive plots can be zoomed in and out of. Do visit the application at: https://jeel.shinyapps.io/TitanicApp/

Enjoy!
